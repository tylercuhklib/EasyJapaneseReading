Create a Japanese learning web app. The app should allow users to input a paragraph of Japanese text, display the text with furigana (hiragana/katakana) above the kanji, and provide a function to search for words in the paragraph and translate them from Japanese to Chinese. Use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Next.js) for the frontend. Integrate with a Japanese morphological analyzer (like kuromoji.js) and a Japanese-Chinese dictionary API or dataset. The UI should support input, display, and search/translation features.

For the exist app, add the following features:
1. Add audio pronunciation for each word in the paragraph.
2. Implement a flashcard system for vocabulary review.

Try to use free and open-source libraries or APIs where possible. Ensure the app is user-friendly and responsive. Provide clear documentation for setup and usage.
